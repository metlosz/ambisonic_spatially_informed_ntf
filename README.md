# ambisonic_spatially_informed_ntf

This repository is related to the paper entitled "[On Ambisonic Source Separation with Spatially Informed Non-negativeTensor Factorization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528859)".
It contains implementation of the reference and the proposed source separation algorithms, as well as the [audio samples](https://metlosz.github.io/ambisonic_spatially_informed_ntf/).

# Installation
The default setup is based on the [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) package manager.
Run the installation script and activate the environment:

> setup.sh

> conda activate asintf

# Usage
Please see the [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html#how-do-i-open-a-specific-notebook) examples.
For detailed information on specific algorithms please refer to the paper.
